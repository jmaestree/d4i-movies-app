## Introduction

We have an initial structure of an app that should show the movies to the user. We have dependencies between the 3 lists. The dependencies are as follows:

1. Year
2. Genres
3. Movies

## Tasks

We should implement the next functionalities:

1. When user enter to the app, show the list of available Years to filter
2. When user selects a Year, show the Genres for this year
3. When user selects a Genre, show the movies for the selected Year and Genre
4. When user selects a Movie, show the detail for this movie

We have to replicate the next layoute:
